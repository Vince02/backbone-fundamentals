# User Wizard



## Overview

MaaxFrame offers administrators a wide range of configuration options to set up their account. Upon your initial log into MaaxFrame, you will be logged in as admin and can do the basic settings from user profile. Once your user profile setup is complete, you can also navifgate to a specific area of MaaxFrame to perform various administrative functions (e.g. importing data, creating users, configuring the application via Module, etc.) as well. Please note that system administrators can also set up each user's basic settings when creating a user in MaaxFrame . This documentation will cover the various options available when first accessing your MaaxFrame  account.



## Login Screen

The MaaxFrame login screen is where you enter your login credentials (username and password) to access your instance. Enter in your instance URL (e.g. https://app1.maaxframe.com/your_instance) on your web browser to load Maax’s login screen. If you do not know your instance URL or login credentials, please reach out to another system administrator in your organization for assistance.

The Your Locale step is where you can configure the date, time, and name format and language you want displayed in MaaxFrame based on your current geographical location. Unlike the system locale settings, this is where you can specify how you would like data displayed in your specific user account. Please note that the information you provide on this page will override the system locale settings and can be updated in your user preferences at a later time if desired. The following options are available to configure your locale settings:

 1. Time Zone : Select the timezone based on your current location.
