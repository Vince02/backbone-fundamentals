## Setting Expectations

The goal of this book is to create an authoritative and centralized repository of information that can help those developing real-world apps with Backbone. If you come across a section or topic which you think could be improved or expanded on, please feel free to submit an issue (or better yet, a pull-request) on the book's [GitHub site](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals). It won't take long and you'll be helping other developers avoid the problems you ran into.

Topics will include MVC theory and how to build applications using Backbone's Models, Views, Collections, and Routers. I'll also be taking you through advanced topics like modular development with Backbone.js and AMD (via RequireJS), solutions to common problems like nested views, how to solve routing problems with Backbone and jQuery Mobile, and much more.

Here is a peek at what you will be learning in each chapter:

<i>Chapter 2, Fundamentals</i> traces the history of the MVC design pattern and introduces how it is implemented by Backbone.js and other JavaScript frameworks.

<i>Chapter 3, Backbone Basics</i> covers the major features of the Backbone.js core and the technologies and techniques you will need to know in order to apply it.

<i>Chapter 4, Exercise 1: Todos - Your First Backbone.js App</i> takes you step-by-step through development of a simple client-side Todo List application.

<i>Chapter 5, Exercise 2: Book Library - Your First RESTful Backbone.js App</i> walks you through development of a Book Library application which persists its model to a server using a REST API.

<i>Chapter 6, Backbone Extensions</i> describes Backbone.Marionette and Thorax, two extension frameworks which add features to Backbone.js that are useful for developing large-scale applications.

<i>Chapter 7, Common Problems and Solutions</i> reviews common issues you may encounter when using Backbone.js and ways of addressing them.

<i>Chapter 8, Modular Development</i> looks at how AMD modules and RequireJS can be used to modularize your code.

<i>Chapter 9, Exercise 3: Todos - Your First Modular Backbone + RequireJS App</i> takes you through rewriting the app created in Exercise 1 to be more modular with the help of RequireJS.

<i>Chapter 10, Paginating Backbone Requests & Collections</i> walks through how to use the Backbone.Paginator plugin to paginate data for your Collections.

<i>Chapter 11, Backbone Boilerplate And Grunt BBB</i> introduces powerful tools you can use to bootstrap a new Backbone.js application with boilerplate code.

<i>Chapter 12, Mobile Applications</i> addresses the issues that arise when using Backbone with jQuery Mobile.

<i>Chapter 13, Jasmine</i> covers how to unit test Backbone code using the Jasmine test framework.

<i>Chapter 14, QUnit</i> discusses how to use QUnit for unit testing.

<i>Chapter 15, SinonJS</i> discusses how to use SinonJS for unit testing your Backbone apps.

<i>Chapter 16, Resources</i> provides references to additional Backbone-related resources.

<i>Chapter 17, Conclusions</i> wraps up our tour through the world of Backbone.js development.

<i>Chapter 18, Appendix</i> returns to our design pattern discussion by contrasting MVC with the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern and examines how Backbone.js relates to both. A walkthrough of writing a Backbone-like library from scratch and other topics are also covered.
